## TL;DR
I released an app to the google playstore which can control smart home devices from homematic using raspberrymatic. For development i used Flutter and the current main features include controlling thermostats, shutters and simple management of programs. The most important things i learned are designing a sustainable architecture for efficient maintenance, state mangement in Flutter, how to securly store credentials on an android device and how to release an app to the playstore.

## Story
A friend of mine had smart home devices from Homematic. As a CCU (Central Control Unit), he used a Raspberry Pi running RaspberryMatic to manage everything. At the time, he was already using an app to control the devices, but there were a few things about it that bothered him. We talked about it, and half-jokingly, he asked if I could build a better app. That sparked my curiosity, and just for fun, I started hacking something together. I quickly realized how much I enjoyed it and gradually got more interested in the topic. Eventually, I even bought my own smart home devices so I could use the app myself. Over time, I kept adding features and maintaining it.

After putting a lot of time into the appâ€”and using it almost daily, especially during winterâ€”I thought it would be awesome if others could download and use it too. So I defined a target feature set and a list of bugs that needed fixing before it would be ready for the Play Store. Once everything was in place, I polished and prepared the app for release. After pushing through the (annoying but mandatory) closed testing phase, the app was finally published on March 30, 2025 ðŸ”¥.

## Technical stuff
### Key data

| Category                      | Answer          | Comment |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------- | :------ |
| Target Platform                   | Android     | My friend and i had both android devices |
| Technology                      | Flutter/Dart    |      I had already used Flutter for university projects and found it very useful for building apps which doesn't use native features |
| RaspberryMatic API | XML-API |   I started with it, because it was very simple and had all the functionality i needed. https://www.homematic-inside.de/software/xml-api |
| Design | Figma |   Figma is very a very powerfull and free tool, which is great for example for creating simple icons |

The first couple of commits were very hacky and just about playing around with the api. But soon i noticed that if i want to continue this app i need to think about some architecture to keep the code maintainable.

### Add suport for new devices
One of the first challenges i faced, was how to efficiently handle the addition of supported devices. Using the XML-API each device has specific attributes. For example like this:
```xml
<device name='HeizkÃ¶rperthermostat Wohnzimmer' ise_id='1643' unreach='false' config_pending='false'>
	<channel name='HeizkÃ¶rperthermostat Wohnzimmer' ise_id='1644' index='0' visible='true' operate='true'>

</device>
```
The device is a radiator thermostat which has attributes like `ACTUAL_TEMPERATURE` and `SET_POINT_TEMPERATURE` which represent the measured temperature and the configured temperature. These attributes can vary depending on the device hence the challenge is to find a way of efficiently manage supported devices without hardcoding each attribute. The solution i came up with, is a mapping file which i call Driver. Each type of the device has usually the same functionalities. For example a thermostat has the functionality to read and set the temperature. So in the mapping file i define the mapping of the actual attributes from the device to a custom property which i actually use in the code. For each supported device type i define custom properties to handle the specific functionality.

When i need to add a new device and the device type is already supported, i just need to add a single file which maps the attribute types from the device to my custom ones which i use in the code. Of course when i add a completely new device type, i also need to add the UI and functionality to make it work.
